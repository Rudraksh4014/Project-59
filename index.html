    <p id="Para"> A terminator named the T-1000, a highly advanced liquid metal terminator is set on a mission to kill Sarah's son, John Connor. However, another cyborg named CSM 101, who was once after Sarah's life, has now been assigned to protect him. This movie has one of the famous actors in the world and of my favourite actors too, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie is also one the most top rated movie in the world with IMDB ratings 8.5/10. I recommend you to watch this amazing action movie.</p>
